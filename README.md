# HTMLSorter
A Java utility I created during my summer position at CFUR Radio Society.

CFUR's website contains a google calendar to display all radio programming for a month. A time-consuming problem with this calendar was that it had to be updated manually whenever radio programming was changed, which it was often. Fortunately, the Radiologik program itself has a local HTML file which was updated whenever programming was changed. I created this utility to generate a CSV file of the monthly radio programming schedule using Radiologik's HTML file. Now, one would only have to upload the CSV file into google calendar to update radio events.
