# HTMLSorter
A Java utility I created during my summer position at CFUR Radio Society.

CFUR's website contains a calendar to display all radio programming for a month. A time-consuming problem was that each individual calendar event had to be updated manually whenever radio programming was changed, which was often. Fortunately, the Radiologik program maintained its schedule using an HTML file which was updated whenever scheduling was changed. I created this utility to generate a CSV file containing the updated radio programming schedule utilizing Radiologik's HTML schedule file. Now, if someone wants to update the online calendar with new scheduling they need only run my program and upload the generated CSV file to the calendar.
